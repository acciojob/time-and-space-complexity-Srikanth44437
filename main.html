	<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity refers to the efficiency of an algorithm concerning the amount of time it takes to execute as a function of the input size. In simpler terms, it measures how the execution time of an algorithm increases with the size of the input. An algorithm is considered more efficient if it has a lower time complexity.</p>
	<p>Space complexity, on the other hand, is a measure of the amount of memory an algorithm uses concerning the input size. In big O notation, often denoted as O(n), space complexity describes the upper bound of memory space required by the algorithm as a function of the input size. <b>Space Complexity</b> is a critical consideration in optimizing algorithms to use memory efficiently.</p>
